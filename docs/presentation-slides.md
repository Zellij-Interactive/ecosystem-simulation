```
dR/dt = births - deaths - predation
dF/dt = hunting_success - deaths
```

## Slide 7: Physics & Collision Detection
**Movement & Interaction Systems**

**Movement Physics**
```typescript
// Basic velocity-based movement
newPosition = currentPosition + velocity * deltaTime

// Boundary constraints (circular world)
if (distanceFromCenter > worldSize) {
  pushTowardsCenter();
}
```

**Collision Detection**
- Distance-based proximity checks
- Hunting: Fox catches rabbit (< 1.2 units)
- Mating: Same species, opposite gender (< 2.0 units)
- Optimized with distance-squared calculations

---

## Slide 8: AI Behavioral Systems
**State-Based Animal Intelligence**

**Rabbit Behavior States**
```
GRAZING → FLEEING → MATING → PREGNANT
```

**Fox Behavior States**
```
WANDERING → HUNTING → MATING → PREGNANT
```

**Decision Making**
```typescript
if (predatorNearby && distance < 6) {
  return FLEE_STATE;
} else if (mateAvailable && canReproduce) {
  return MATE_STATE;
} else {
  return DEFAULT_STATE;
}
```

---

## Slide 9: Key Implementation - Collision Detection
**Efficient Spatial Calculations**

```typescript
// Optimized distance calculation (avoid sqrt)
const distanceSquared = (a, b) => {
  const dx = a.x - b.x;
  const dz = a.z - b.z;
  return dx * dx + dz * dz;
};

// Find closest prey for hunting
const findClosestRabbit = (fox, rabbits) => {
  let closest = null;
  let minDistance = Infinity;
  
  for (const rabbit of rabbits) {
    const distance = distanceSquared(fox.position, rabbit.position);
    if (distance < minDistance) {
      minDistance = distance;
      closest = rabbit;
    }
  }
  return closest;
};
```

## Slide 10: Reproduction System

## Slide 11: State Management
**Zustand Store Architecture**

```typescript
interface SimulationState {
  rabbits: AgentType[];
  foxes: AgentType[];
  isPaused: boolean;
  speedFactor: number;
  simulationTime: number;
  
  // Actions
  togglePause: () => void;
