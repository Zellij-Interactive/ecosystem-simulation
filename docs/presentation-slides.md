};

// Nearest neighbor search
const findClosestPrey = (predator: Agent, preyList: Agent[]) => {
  let closest = null;
  let minDistance = Infinity;
  
  for (const prey of preyList) {
    const distance = distanceSquared(predator.position, prey.position);
    if (distance < minDistance) {
      minDistance = distance;
      closest = prey;
    }

## Slide 12: Key Algorithms - Reproduction System
**Gender-Based Breeding Mechanics**

**Mating Requirements**

- Minimum age and reproduction cooldown
- Proximity requirement (within 2.0 units)

**Pregnancy & Birth**
- Gestation periods (8 sec rabbits, 15 sec foxes)
- Litter sizes (2-4 rabbits, 1-2 foxes)
- Energy costs for pregnancy and birth
- Offspring inherit random gender

## Slide 13: Mathematical Models
**Scientific Foundation**

**Energy Balance Equations**
```
dE/dt = -consumption_rate + energy_gain - reproduction_cost

Rabbits: dE/dt = -0.8 + 3.0 - pregnancy_cost
Foxes: dE/dt = -2.5 + hunt_success - pregnancy_cost
```

**Population Dynamics (Modified Lotka-Volterra)**
```
dR/dt = birth_rate × R - death_rate × R - predation_rate × R × F
dF/dt = efficiency × predation_rate × R × F - death_rate × F
```

Where R = Rabbit population, F = Fox population
