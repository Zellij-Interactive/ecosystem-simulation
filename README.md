# 3D Ecosystem Simulation

An interactive 3D ecosystem simulation running in the browser, built with **Three.js**.

The simulation models a simple ecosystem with two types of agents:
- *Rabbits* (prey) — wander and reproduce
- *Foxes* (predators) — seek, hunt, and consume rabbits to survive

The project demonstrates core concepts of **3D graphics**, **movement**, **agent-based behavior**, **collision detection**, and **real-time interaction**.

## Features

- Rabbits wander the environment and reproduce.
- Foxes hunt and consume rabbits to gain energy.
- Agents have an energy-based lifecycle (reproduction, starvation, death).
- Dynamic simulation on a 3D terrain.
- Stable performance with increasing population.
